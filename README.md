This is a minor-project of about 200 lines of code created in Python with the motive of using my-sql in python. 

The program intends to find trains available for the user. It takes as input the stations from which the user wants to go and to which (s)3he 
wants to go. It then based on available database of trains suggest the trains user can book for his journey. If no trains are available with 
preferred pick up and drop platforms, it simply suggests to try another stations.
